How to access the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IHostingEnvironment from a PlugIn's Configure?

In the constructor of the SSAppHost : AppHostBase, I pass an instance of an IWebHostEnvironment, and constructor-inject that to an auto-property on SSAppHost by the name of WebHostEnvironemnt. Then in the `SSAppHost`, I can call the `.IsDevelopment()`, `.IsStaging()`, and `.isProduction()`. to know the environment. Those extension methods work on a type `IHostingEnvironment`.  The SSAppHost is adding PlugIns, and the PlugIn should be able to use the same method for identifying the environment its been activated in. I'm afraid I can't see how to give a PlugIn access to the instance. Oh wait - I can DI and put the instance into the `Container` by Type. There are other Hosting Environments in the full solution, but from the SSAppHost to each PlugIn, this is the only one a plugin needs to see this isn't the only, but maybe it is the only instance of this type that I'd like to make available to the PlugIn. a I can pass this reference to the extension method `.IsDevelopment()` Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.HostingEnvironmentExtensions
